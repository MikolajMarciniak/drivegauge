# Frontend Prototype

To run the application you have to install NodeJS v16+ and NPM v8+. You can do that by going to https://nodejs.org/en/ and following the instructions on how to do that for your system.

Once you've cloned the repo and installed Node, you can run the frontend by typing `npm run start` into the command line. This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

You can also find an already hosted version at [cs3028.hel1.as207960.net](http://cs3028.hel1.as207960.net/dashboard)

You can run the jest tests by typing `npm test` into the command line. This will run all of the jest tests in the terminal.


docker build --tag frontend .
