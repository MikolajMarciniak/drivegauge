# Information on the datasets

1. archive.zip dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/driving-behavior-dataset?resource=download&select=sero_features_16.csv

- Dataset for modeling risky driver behaviors based on accelerometer (X,Y,Z axis in meters per second squared (m/s2)) and gyroscope (X,Y, Z axis in degrees per second (Â°/s) ) data.

2. Driver_Behaviour_Recognition-master.zip - https://github.com/yoshino0705/Driver_Behavior_Recognition

- It is part of a project mainly focusing on evaluating the performance of some driving dataset using several traditional machine learning models.

3. driverBehaviourDataset-master.zip - https://github.com/jair-jr/driverBehaviorDataset

- The dataset is a collection of smartphone sensor measurements for driving events. An Android application is used to record smartphone sensor data, like accelerometer, linear acceleration, magnetometer and gyroscope, while a driver executed particular driving events.
