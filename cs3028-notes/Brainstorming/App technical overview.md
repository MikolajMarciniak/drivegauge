## Our subproducts
1. The box:
	 - runs on a microcontroller with an ODB port adapter
	 - runs custom rust software
	 - takes raw ODB data, preprocesses it, sends it to the main server

2. The backend:
	- runs on a external server (for proof of concept a laptop is enough)
	- runs custom python software
	- processes and stores the data from the connected boxes
	- serves the frontend

3.  The frontend:
	- runs on client computer, most likely in browser
	- made in some front-end framework
	- presents nicely the data generated by the backend
