Before choosing a graph library to work with on our project we had to think about what exactly do we need and how are we going to use it.
Firstly, we had to take into consideration the fact that the project is created with React.js, so therefore the library we are going to use has to be a JS library. 
Secondly, we wanted to have different types of graphs so we can display different types of data appropriately. Also, we want to be able to animate these graphs so that they are easier to read and more interactive to our users.
Thirdly, the library has to be a well-known one and open-source because if we encounter some issues or difficulties while working with it, there is a greater chance that other people would have already discovered it and solved it. 
Finally, the intended library has to be simple to use, easy to learn and free as we don't want to spend too much time on this part of the project because we are already tight on schedule on don't want to spend money on such simple components.
That is why a research on this topic was conducted and the following options were discovered:
- Chart.js - https://www.chartjs.org/
	- Simple and elegant with a size of only 60kb. Comes with 8 different types of charts and latest advanced animation options. Open source and famous. Good documentation to get started.
- ApexCharts.js - https://apexcharts.com/
	- Open source and very popular with over 1 million monthly downloads. Offers 10+ color palettes. Has animation options.
- Billboard.js - https://naver.github.io/billboard.js/
	- Very simple and easy to use. Open source and easy way to insert data into charts. Less famous than the other two options.

After looking at these facts and discussing the options with the whole team, we have decided to use the Chart.js as it is not only the most famous and elegant one, which would presumably ease our jon, but it is also the lightest one.
