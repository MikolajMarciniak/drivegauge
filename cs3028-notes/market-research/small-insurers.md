## List of small insurance companies that don't use Littlebox

* NFU Mutual https://www.nfumutual.co.uk/insurance/motor-insurance/car-insurance/#do_you_provide_car_insurance_for_young_drivers
    + They don't have a system which rewards good driving at all. 
    + They only reward loyal clients.
    + If you are a younger driver and want to insure a car, your parents should be insured at NFU Mutual. 
    + If you enter the Young Drivers Scheme, which has a training programme. With it you can gain bonuses.

* Ageas https://www.ageas.co.uk/car-insurance/
    + Don't seem to have specific young driver insurance
    + No information about Littlebox or similar app on the website

* esure https://www.esure.com/car-insurance
    + Quote from website: "Though itâ€™s not always the case that younger drivers have less experience, statistically they are a higher risk and typically can end up paying more for their car insurance. Usually experience comes with age and therefore, you could see a reduction in your premium the older you are"
    + Indication of willingness to judge the drivers by their way of driving and skill, not only by age
    + The Littlebox could help them reach this goal
