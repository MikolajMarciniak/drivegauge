What metrics can we measure a driver’s safety by? AKA What do other companies use?

* Do we need a map with speed limits to determine speed safety.
    * Needs leeway as it is always more safe to go the speed of everyone around you than to follow the law
* Map for context of stop signs, school zones, etc.
* Measure sudden stops
* A bit invasive but listening to music loudness? Other distracting elements?
* Look at past record
* Ideally, cameras to check car distances at stops and while driving
* Average time of day driving…
    * Is late night driving substantially more dangerous?
* Smoothness of driving, accelerating too hard etc
* Mileage, drive more = more experienced but also higher probability of being in a crash
* Driving during bad weather
* Does the driver make sharp turns? Sudden movements etc
* Phone usage, even hands free

How are we different from other companies like Lemonade Insurance, or the new Tesla app, Allstate drivewise, liberty mutual insurance righttrack?

How do we keep all this data secure?

80% of blackbox insurance customers can reduce their quotes, would a small company be able to afford losing that money?
